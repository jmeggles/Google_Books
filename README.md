  ## Motivation
  Inspired by a class project. I wanted to build an app to showcase my knowledge of how MongoDB, Express, React, and NojeJs work together for a fullstack MERN application.

  ## Installation ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm?color=pink&style=plastic) 
  No install needed. Just follow [this link](https://www.herokuapp.com/) to the deployed application!

  Or, clone application, then in the root folder add package with `npm i` then `npm start` to run application. Installation of MongoDB wil also need to be added.
